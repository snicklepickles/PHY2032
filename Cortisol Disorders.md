#Stress 
## Adrenal Insufficiency
- Also known as Addison’s disease
- Infections are usually fatal in the *absence* of [[Cortisol|cortisol]]
- **Symptoms:**
	- Weakness
	- Fatigue
	- Loss of appetite
	- Loss of weight
	- Increased skin pigmentation
	- Low blood sugar levels
- Due to loss of adrenocortical function (primary)
	- Normally caused by *autoimmune* disease
	- *All* zones of the adrenal cortex are affected
- Aldosterone levels also decrease → *hypotension*
- Treatment: 
	- Daily oral administration of glucocorticoids & mineralocorticoids
## Cushing’s Syndrome
- Caused by *excess* circulating cortisol
- Due to:
	- Cortisol-secreting tumour of the adrenal gland (primary)
	- ACTH-secreting tumour of the anterior pituitary (secondary)
	- Pharmacological use of exogenous corticosteroids
		- Most *common* cause
- Increased cortisol promotes catabolism of bone, muscle, skin & other organs
	- Bone strength diminishes
	- Muscles weaken
	- Skin becomes easily bruised
- Cortisol-induced tissue catabolism causes blood sugar levels to increase to those observed in diabetes mellitus
- Fat is lost from extremities
	- Redistributes in trunk, face & back
	- Cortisol also triggers increased appetite
		- Patients can quickly develop abdominal obesity
- Suppresses the immune system
- Can potentially cause *hypertension*
- Treatment:
	- Cessation of corticosteroid treatment
	- Surgical removal of tumour
