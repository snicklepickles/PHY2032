## Pancreas
- Secretes **insulin** & **glucagon**
	- Polypeptide hormones secreted by the [[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism#Islets of Langerhans|Islets of Langerhans]]
	- Control the transition from [[Absorptive & Postabsorptive States#Absorptive State|absorptive]] â†’ [[Absorptive & Postabsorptive States#Postabsorptive State|post-absorptive]]
### Islets of Langerhans 
- 100-200 microns in diameter
- Contain ~1000 endocrine cells
- 2-3 million islets distributed throughout the pancreas
	- Combined mass: 1-2 grams
	- 1-2% of pancreatic mass

- Have rich supply of capillaries into which hormones are secreted
- Sympathetic & parasympathetic neurons terminate on the islets

#### $\beta$-Cells (70%)
- Secrete [[Insulin|insulin]]
- Sense $\Delta[\text{glucose}_\text{plasma}]$
- Form intimate contact with *vasculature* (RBCs)
	- Receive 10$\times$ amount of blood as surrounding cells
#### $\alpha$-Cells (20%)
- Secrete [[Glucagon|glucagon]]
#### $\delta$-Cells (<10%)
- Secrete **somatostatin**
- Paracrine factor that fine tunes insulin & glucagon secretion
#### PP-Cells (<5%)
- Secrete **pancreatic polypeptide**
- Roles in GI tract & metabolism
