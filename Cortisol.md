#Stress 

- Steroid hormone in the *glucocorticoid* class
![[Cortisol-20240801182639377.png|241]]
- Synthesised in the **zona fasciculata** of the [[Adrenal Gland#Adrenal Cortex|adrenal cortex]]
<<<<<<< HEAD
![[Cortisol-20240801182722274.png|560]]
- ACTH stimulates cortisol production:
	- Increases $[\text{cholesterol}]$ in inner mitochondrial membrane
		- Via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (**StAR**) 
		- Cholesterol transfer is rate-limiting step

- ACTH stimulates cortisol production:
	- Increases $[\text{cholesterol}]$ in inner mitochondrial membrane
		- Via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein
>>>>>>> origin/main
	- Increases production of the enzyme **CYP11A1**
		- Cholesterol → pregnenolone is rate-limiting step
## Cortisol Secretion
- Follows a **circadian** pattern
- Follows ACTH pulses
![[Cortisol-20240801183100563.png]]
- Normal: 5-25 $\mu g/dl$ 
- *Cortisol awakening response:*
	- Cortisol levels peak in first few hours after waking
	- Maintains blood glucose, stimulates appetite & prepares for potentially stressful situations
## Mechanism of Action
- Cortisol is transported in blood
- Predominantly bound to *corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)*
	- Circulating half-life: ~70 minutes
- *Liver* is the predominant site of cortisol *inactivation*

=======

>>>>>>> origin/main
1. At target cells, cortisol is released from CBG
2. Crosses plasma membrane to bind to *cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors* in cells
3. Cortisol-receptor complex dimerises and is rapidly translocated to the nucleus
4. Binds to specific sites on DNA (**glucocorticoid response elements**)
- Proteins synthesised in response to cortisol vary depending upon the specific genes affected in a given cell

## Physiological Actions
![[Cortisol-20240801190237616.png]]
- Partitions energy to cope with stress by inhibiting non-essential functions with high anabolic cost:
	- Reproduction and growth
### Metabolic Actions
- Glucocorticoid → regulates blood glucose
- Cortisol is a major [[Glucose Counter-Regulatory Hormones|glucose counter-regulatory hormone]]
- Role is minimal during fed state
- Important during *fasting* to maintain:
	- $\uparrow$ plasma glucose levels
	- CNS function
- During **stress**, increases blood glucose
![[Cortisol-20240801185430270.png]]
- Increases hepatic glucose production between meals
### Cardiovascular Actions
- Like thyroid hormone, cortisol has **permissive** effects on catecholamines
- Increases adrenergic receptor expression
### Immune Actions
- Maintains immune homeostasis
- Cortisol, along with adrenaline & noradrenaline:
	- Represses production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
	- Stimulates production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
- Cortisol inhibits production of inflammatory mediators

### Reproductive Actions
- Reproduction exacts a considerable anabolic cost on the organism
- In humans, reproductive behaviour & function are dampened in response to [[Stress|stress]]
- Cortisol decreases the function of the reproductive axis at the hypothalamic, pituitary & gonadal levels
- Chronic elevation of cortisol inhibits GH-IGF-1 axis
<<<<<<< HEAD
	- Reduction in linear growth

	- Reduction in linear growth
## Adrenal Insufficiency
- Also known as Addison’s disease
- Infections are usually fatal in the *absence* of cortisol
- **Symptoms:**
	- Weakness
	- Fatigue
	- Loss of appetite
	- Loss of weight
	- Increased skin pigmentation
	- Low blood sugar levels
- Due to loss of adrenocortical function (primary)
	- Normally caused by *autoimmune* disease
	- *All* zones of the adrenal cortex are affected
- Aldosterone levels also decrease → *hypotension*
- Treatment: 
	- Daily oral administration of glucocorticoids & mineralocorticoids
## Cushing’s Syndrome
- Caused by *excess* circulating cortisol
- Due to:
	- Cortisol-secreting tumour of the adrenal gland (primary)
	- ACTH-secreting tumour of the anterior pituitary (secondary)
	- Pharmacological use of exogenous corticosteroids
		- Most *common* cause
- Increased cortisol promotes catabolism of bone, muscle, skin & other organs
	- Bone strength diminishes
	- Muscles weaken
	- Skin becomes easily bruised
- Cortisol-induced tissue catabolism causes blood sugar levels to increase to those observed in diabetes mellitus
- Fat is lost from extremities
	- Redistributes in trunk, face & back
	- Cortisol also triggers increased appetite
		- Patients can quickly develop abdominal obesity
- Suppresses the immune system
- Can potentially cause *hypertension*
- Treatment:
	- Cessation of corticosteroid treatment
	- Surgical removal of tumour
