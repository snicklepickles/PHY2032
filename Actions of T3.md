#Growth

- T3 synthesised in [[Thyroid Gland#Thyroid Follicle|thyroid follicle]] or from T4
- **Monocarboxylate transporter MCT8/10** transports T3/T4 across membrane
- T3 receptor is present in nuclei of most cells
	- Widespread effects
- Induces gene transcription & protein synthesis

## CNS
- Formation of axon terminals & synapses
- Growth of dendrites & dendritic extensions
- Formation of myelin
- Absence of T3 â†’ **congenital hypothyroidism**
	- Poorly developed CNS
	- Severely compromised intellectual function
## Metabolism
![[Actions of T3-20240714123931849.png]]
- [[Metabolic States#Post-Absorptive State|Net catabolic activity]]
- Much of the provided energy is used to support activity of **$\text{Na}^{+}\text{-}\text K^+$ ATP-ases** 
	- Stimulated by $\text T_3$
- 1/5 of animal cell energy expenditure
	- 2/3 of neurons
- By-product: significant *heat* production

## Cardiovascular
- T3 potentiates/**permits** the actions of *catecholamines*
- Effects of adrenaline & noradrenaline:
	- $\uparrow$ Heart rate
	- $\uparrow$ Nervous activity
	- $\uparrow$ Sweating
- Upregulates *beta-adrenergic* receptors in many tissues
	- E.g., heart & nervous system
