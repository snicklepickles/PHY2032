#Growth

- T3 synthesised in [[Thyroid Gland#Thyroid Follicle|thyroid follicle]] or from T4
- **Monocarboxylate transporter MCT8/10** transports T3/T4 across membrane
- T3 *receptor* is present in nuclei of most cells
	- Widespread effects
- Induces gene transcription & protein synthesis

## CNS
- Formation of axon terminals & synapses
- Growth of dendrites & dendritic extensions
- Formation of myelin
- Absence of T3 → **congenital hypothyroidism**
	- Poorly developed CNS
	- Severely compromised intellectual function
- T3 *enhances*:
	- Wakefulness
	- Alertness
	- Responsiveness to various stimuli
		- Auditory sense
		- Awareness of hunger
	- Memory
	- Learning capacity
## Metabolism
- Affects to lesser extent than insulin

- **[[Metabolic States#Post-Absorptive State|Net catabolic activity]]**
- Much of the provided energy is used to support activity of **$\text{Na}^{+}\text{-}\text K^+$ ATP-ases** 
	- Stimulated by $\text T_3$
- 1/5 of animal cell energy expenditure
	- Up to 2/3 of neurons’
- Purpose:
	- Maintain RMP
	- Affects transport
	- Regulates cellular volume
	- Controls activity state of neurons
- By-product: **highly significant** *heat* production

## Cardiovascular
- Cardiac effects are *permissive*
- T3 potentiates/**permits** the actions of *catecholamines*
- $\uparrow$ Effects of adrenaline & noradrenaline:
	- $\uparrow$ Heart rate
	- $\uparrow$ Nervous activity
	- $\uparrow$ Sweating
- Upregulates *beta-adrenergic* receptors in many tissues
	- E.g., heart & nervous system
