- A [[Glucagon#Glucose Counter-Regulatory Hormones|glucose counter-regulatory hormone]]
- 29 aa polypeptide produced by [[Pancreas#$ alpha$-Cells (20%)|alpha cells]] in the pancreas
- Receptor primarily on surface of liver cells
- Small protein; half life <5 mins
	- Rapidly degraded in liver & kidney
- Used to treat *hypoglycaemia*
## [[Metabolic States#Postabsorptive State|Post-Absorptive State]]
- Triggered by $\downarrow$ blood glucose or $\uparrow$ aaâ€™s

- GIT: GI tract
- *Both* insulin & glucagon released after a *protein-rich* meal
	- Glucagon prevents hyperglycaemia following increase in insulin
## Glucose Counter-Regulatory Hormones
- *Opposes* the action of [[Insulin|insulin]]
