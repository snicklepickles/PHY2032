#Growth 

- 191 aa protein
- Most abundant [[Pituitary Gland#Anterior Pituitary Hormones|anterior pituitary hormone]]
- Most GH circulates *free* in plasma
	- Half-life: 10-20 mins
- 40% bound to *Growth Hormone Binding Protein (GHBP)*
	- Increases half-life

## Growth Hormone Secretion
- **GHRH**: $\uparrow$ cAMP → $\uparrow$ GH
- **Somatostatin**: $\downarrow$ cAMP → $\downarrow$ GH

- *Postprandial*: following a meal
- Some factors relate to GH’s role in [[Glucose Counter-Regulatory Hormones|glucose counter-regulation]], not growth

## Mechanism of Action
![[Growth Hormone-20240714132300300.png]]
1. GH binds to receptors on target cells
2. Activation of **JAK2** & ***Src*** family kinases
3. Initiate intracellular signalling cascades
4. Control transcription of genes required for growth & metabolism
- Many actions of GH are regulated via **Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)**
## Insulin-Like Growth Factors
![[Growth Hormone-20240714132400410.png]]
- Structurally similar to *insulin*
- GH’s effects on **cell growth** are **indirect** via IGFs
	- Primarily **IGF1** in the post-natal period
- GH stimulates *liver* cells to secrete IGF1
	- Enters blood (*endocrine*)
- GH stimulates other cells (e.g., *bone*) to secrete IGF1
	- *Autocrine/paracrine*
- IGFs are bound in blood to one of 6 binding proteins (**IGFBP**s)
- The short stature of some African pygmies is due to:
	- Inability to synthesise significant amounts of IGF-1
	- Despite normal GH levels
## GH Actions
- Major growth-promoting effects:
	- Stimulation of *cell division* in target tissues
	- Include bone & muscle

### Bone Growth
- Bone is a living, metabolically active tissue
- Consists of a collagen matrix upon which calcium phosphate is deposited
- A growing long bone is divided into the *epiphyses* and the *shaft*
![[Growth Hormone-20240714134415259.png|410]]
- At epiphyseal growth plate:
	- **Chondrocytes** lay down new cartilage
	- **Osteoblasts** convert cartilaginous tissue to bone
- Linear growth of shaft *ceases* when growth plates themselves are converted to bone
	- Result of sex steroid actions toward end of puberty
- GH promotes bone-lengthening by stimulating maturation & cell division of **chondrocytes**
	- Continuously *widens* the plates
![[Growth Hormone-20240714133209238.png]]
1. Initially, GH increases *both* tissue *weight* & *height*
	- Until epiphyses of long bones *fuse*
2. Subsequently, only tissue *weight* increases
