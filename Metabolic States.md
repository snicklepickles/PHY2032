* Regular availability of food only in *recent* human history
	* Mechanisms have evolved for survival during alternating periods of feast & famine
* Body undergoes 2 functional states to provide energy for cellular activities:
	1. **Absorptive state**
		* Ingested nutrients enter the blood from the GI tract
	2. **Postabsorptive state**
		1. GI tract is *empty* of nutrients
		2. Body's *own stores* must supply energy
![[Absorptive & Postabsorptive States-20240703172312927.png]]
## Absorptive State
- Net *anabolism* of protein, triglyceride & glycogen
![[Absorptive & Postabsorptive States-20240703175305551.png]]
### Amino Acids
* *All* cells take up amino acids for protein synthesis
* Liver cells use amino acids to generate carbohydrate-like intermediates (*$\alpha$-keto acids*)
	* By removal of the amino ($\text{NH}_3$) group
	* Enter Krebs cycle to provide energy for cells
### Triglycerides
* Absorbed lipids are packaged into *chylomicrons*
	* Large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
	* Liver → lymph → blood circulation
* Fatty acids of plasma chylomicrons are released mainly within *adipose* tissue capillaries
	* By action of endothelial lipoprotein *lipase*
* Released fatty acids diffuse into adipocytes
	* Combine with glycerol 3-phosphate to reform triglycerides
### Glucose
* Body’s major energy source during absorptive state
* All tissues: Catabolised to $\text{CO}_{2} + \text{H}_2\text{O}+\:$energy for ATP formation
* Muscle → glycogen
* Liver → glycogen/glycerol 3-phosphate/fatty acids
## Post-Absorptive State
- Net *catabolism* of protein, triglyceride & glycogen

- Maintains blood glucose levels
	- Normally, CNS utilises only glucose for energy
- **Gluconeogenesis**
	- Synthesis of glucose from precursors, e.g., amino acids & glycerol
	- During a 24 hour fast, provides ~180 g glucose
- **Glucose Sparing**
	- Most organs & tissues (excluding nervous):
		- Significantly reduce glucose catabolism
		- Increase fat utilisation
- Liver can convert fatty acids to *ketones*
	- Provide important energy source during prolonged fasting
### Glycogenolysis
- First line of defence against falling blood glucose levels 
	- Can only provide enough for 2-3 hours
- Liver: direct, muscle: indirect
### Lipolysis
 * The catabolism of triglycerides in adipose tissue
 * Yields glycerol & fatty acids
	 * Diffuse into bloodstream to reach liver
### Protein
- Few hours into postabsorptive state
- Protein → AAs → liver → $\alpha$-keto acid pathway → glucose
