## Parathyroid Gland
- 4 separate glands embedded in the posterior surface of the [[Thyroid Gland|thyroid gland]]
- 12-15% of people have 5 glands

- Each gland is the size of a grain of rice
	- Weighs ~30 mg
- Critical for calcium regulation
- Completely distinct from the thyroid gland

## Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
- Secreted by the *chief* cells of the parathyroid glands
- An 84 aa protein
- Enzymatic cleavage can release an N-terminal 34 aa fragment (PTH 1-34), which is also active

- **Half-life**: 2-4 mins
1. PTH is produced and secreted by chief cells of parathyroid gland
2. Calcium sensing receptor initiates a downstream signalling cascade, **inhibiting**:
	- PTH gene transcription
	- PH release from stored vesicles

3. Low extracellular calcium switches off receptor â†’ removes inhibition
## Actions of PTH
![[Parathyroid Gland-20240808211427765.png]]
- PTH decreases reabsorption of phosphate ions in kidney
	- Increases excretion in urine
	- Keeps plasma phosphate levels from increasing due to actions from PTH
