#Growth 

- *Organised* addition of new tissue 
- Occurs in development from infancy to adulthood
![[Growth-20240714142458094.png]]
- Involves an increase in:
	- Cell size (hypertrophy)
	- Cell number (hyperplasia)
- Differentiation to perform highly specialised functions
- Depends on locally-produced **growth factors**
	- Work via paracrine/autocrine mechanisms
	- IGFs, TGF-$\beta$s, FGFs, etc.
## Growth Assessment
- Use of growth charts
- Careful history & examination
- Biochemical & imaging assessment
![[Growth-20240714142959508.png]]
- Contributors to abnormal growth:
	- Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
	- Systemic disorders (esp. small bowel disease)
	- Evidence of skeletal or chromosomal abnormalities
	- Endocrine status
	- Dietary intake & drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids for asthma)
	- Emotional & psychological problems
## Endocrine Growth Factors
### Growth Hormone (IGF-1)
- See [[Growth Hormone#Insulin-Like Growth Factors|Insulin-Like Growth Factors]]
### Thyroid Hormones
- See [[Actions of T3]]
- Do not alone stimulate growth (requires GH)
- Required for setting *metabolic rate*
- Control growth & development of *nervous system* + linear growth & maturation of *bones*
- **Cretinism** occurs in TH-deficient babies
- Hypothyroidism before puberty → growth retardation
	- Can respond to therapy (catch-up growth)

### Glucocorticoids
- Inhibit growth of all tissues, except gonads
![[Growth-20240714143755772.png]]
- Causes of corticoid excess in children:
	- Adrenal tumours
	- Cushing’s disease
	- Excess glucocorticoid therapy for inflammatory disorders
- Cortisol is a type of glucocorticoid
### Sex Steroids
- See [[Sex Steroids]]
- Testosterone & estrogen
- Induce typical patterns of growth at puberty:
	1. Distal (hands & feet)
	2. Arms & legs
	3. Trunk
- Major growth-promoting effect:
	- Stimulate secretion of GH & IGF-1
- Promote *epiphyseal fusion* of the long bones
	- *Terminates* the adolescent growth spurt
- **Testosterone** (**DHT**) actions are linear
	- Promote increases in muscle mass & body weight 
- Tissues are exquisitely *sensitive* to **estrogen**
	- Very low concentrations stimulate growth
	- High concentrations inhibit growth
#### Anabolic Steroids
- Include testosterone, synthetic androgens, DHEA & androstenedione
- Effects of abuse:
	- Liver damage
	- Increased risk of prostate cancer
	- Infertility
	- Changes in behaviour & emotions
	- Virilisation in females
### [[Insulin]]
- **Required** in order for GH to promote growth
![[Growth-20240714150422901.png]]
- *Anabolic* hormone
	- Promotes transport of glucose & amino acids into muscle and fat cells
	- Stimulates storage of fat
	- *Inhibits protein degradation*
- Important in utero
	- Stimulates growth of foetus
	- Likely via IGF-1 receptor
![[Growth-20240714150536163.png]]
- Insulin deficiency in children → growth retardation
	- Controlled with insulin treatment
- **Leprechaunism** is due to insulin *receptor* defects
	- Children are born small and stay well below normal size
