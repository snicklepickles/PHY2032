#Metabolism 

- A metabolic disease characterised by elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia)
- Results from *relative* or *absolute* deficiency of [[Insulin|insulin]]
- Originally diagnosed by the **glucose tolerance test (GTT)**
![[Diabetes-20240709010449163.png]]
- More recently, the **glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)** test is used
	- Haemoglobin is a long-lived protein (RBC lifespan = 3 mos)
	- Constantly exposed to glucose in the blood → glycated
		- <5.7% is normal
		- >6.5% is diabetes
## Type 1 vs Type 2

## Gestational Diabetes
- A temporary condition in pregnancy
- Body cannot cope with extra demand for insulin production
## Acute Effects of Hyperglycaemia

## Chronic Complications of Diabetes

### Macrovascular Complications
- Hyperglycaemia damages blood vessels → **atherosclerosis**
![[Diabetes-20240709115036406.png|509]]
- Decreased blood flow to:
	- Heart → heart attack
	- Brain → stroke
	- Extremities → pain/decreased healing
### Microvascular Complications
- Characterised by:
	- Vasoconstriction
	- Increased capillary permeability (haemorrhage)
	- Proliferation of extracellular matrix (fibrous tissue)
	- Capillary occlusion (aneurysm)
#### Retinopathy

#### Nephropathy
![[Diabetes-20240709115453710.png]]
- High glucose in filtrate → $\uparrow$ urine excretion & renin secretion → vasoconstriction of renal arterioles & infarction of surrounding tissue → **glomeruli destroyed**
- Most common cause of chronic kidney failure & end-stage kidney disease
- Leading cause of premature death in diabetic patients aged 50-70
#### Neuropathy
![[Diabetes-20240709120455197.png|676]]
- High glucose levels damage nerve fibres directly
- Depending on affected nerves:
	- Pain & numbness in extremities
	- Problems w/digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels & heart
