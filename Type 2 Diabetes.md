#Metabolism 

- 90% of [[Diabetes|diabetes]] cases
- Adult onset diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
- Body produces [[Insulin|insulin]] but can’t use it well
## Causes
### Insulin Resistance
- Muscle, liver & fat cells do not properly respond to insulin
- Insulin signalling pathway is compromised, most likely by:
	- Ectopic lipid accumulation
	- Activation of inflammatory pathways
### [[Pancreas#$ beta$-Cells (70%)|Beta Cell]] Compensation
- $\beta$-cells increase insulin production
- Cannot be sustained; demand leads to *dysfunction*
- $\beta$-cells are exhausted; insulin production declines

- Hyperglycaemia may develop gradually, without obvious symptoms
- Mild presentation, but underlying:
	- [[Diabetes#Chronic Complications of Diabetes|Microvascular & macrovascular complications]]
### Genetic Disposition
- Most people with type 2 diabetes have a family member who also has type 2 diabetes
- Identical twins 90% lifetime concordance
- More than 100 genes can contribute to risk
### Environmental Risk Factors
- Major contributors to development
- Risk is greatly increased by modifiable lifestyle factors:
	- Overweight
	- Lack of exercise
	- Unhealthy eating
## Obesity
![[Type 2 Diabetes-20240709013906836.png]]
- Obese individuals are typically insulin-resistant

1. Increased production of insulin-resistance-promoting cytokines
	- By expanded visceral fat depos & immune cells
	- E.g., interleukin 6,TNF-$\alpha$ 
2. Ectopic fat deposition impairs insulin signalling
	- Particularly in the liver
	- Activates additional inflammatory pathways
3. Mitochondrial dysfunction & ER stress
	- Within muscle & liver cells

## Pathophysiology
![[Type 2 Diabetes-20240709014411350.png]]
1. Insulin resistance develops in peripheral tissues
2. Pancreas produces more insulin to overcome resistance
3. $\beta$-cells fail → $\downarrow$ insulin → $\downarrow$ glucose uptake → hyperglycaemia
4. $\uparrow$ glucose production & release from liver → exacerbation
5. $\downarrow$ glucose utilisation → $\uparrow$ lipolysis → $\uparrow$ FFAs
	- Lipotoxic & glucotoxic effects on the pancreas → exacerbation
- Other contributing factors to $\beta$-cell failure: 
	- Changing microbiota
	- $\downarrow$ GLP1 production from gut
	- Inflammatory factors
- Hyperglycaemia → $\uparrow$ gut glucose absorption & kidney reabsorption
## Treatment
- Change in lifestyle
- Aim to reduce blood glucose & lipid levels through weight loss, diet & exercise

- If ineffective, insulin may be required
