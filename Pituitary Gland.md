#Growth

- Also known as the **hypophysis**
- Lies in the pocket of the **sphenoid bone** (base of the brain) 
![[Pituitary Gland-20240709122537891.png|393]]
- Connected to the hypothalamus by the **infundibulum**
    - Also known as **pituitary stalk**
    - Contains axons from neurons from hypothalamus & small blood vessels
- Consists of **2 adjacent lobes**

## Posterior Pituitary
- Also known as **neurohypophysis**
- **Not** a gland
- Extension of the neural components of the hypothalamus
### Oxytocin & Vasopressin/ADH
- Synthesised in separate clusters of neurons within the *PVN* & *SON*
- Transported down axon to nerve terminals in the **posterior pituitary**
	- Nerve terminals hold lots of vesicles
	- Pouch out to form **herring bodies**
- Neurotransmitters acting on neurons in the SON & PVN generate an AP which propagates along the axon and causes **exocytosis** of stored hormone
- Oxytocin & vasopressin enter general circulation ⇒ Act on distant organs

## Anterior Pituitary
- Also known as **adenohypophysis**
- Arises embryologically from an invagination of the pharynx (**Rathke's pouch**)
### Median Eminence
- Junction of the hypothalamus & infundibulum
- Capillaries recombine to form the **hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels**
	- Offer a local group for the blood to be delivered directly from the median eminence to clusters of endocrine cells within the anterior pituitary
### Hypophysiotropic Hormones
- Also known as **hypothalamic-releasing/inhibiting hormones**
- Produced by **parvocellular nuclei (PVN)** in hypothalamus
	- Neuron terminals end in the **median eminence**
- Regulate **anterior pituitary** function
- Each of the hypophysiotropic hormones is the first in a *3 hormone sequence*, **except dopamine**
	1. A *hypophysiotropic* hormone, which controls secretion of
	2. An *anterior pituitary* hormone, which controls secretion of
	3. A hormone from another *endocrine gland*
- Examples: 
	- Corticotropin-releasing hormone **(CRH)**
	- Thyrotropin-releasing hormone **(TRH)**
	- Somatostatin **(SST)**
	- Growth hormone-releasing hormone **(GHRH)**
	- Gonadotropin-releasing hormone **(GnRH)**
	- Dopamine **(DA)**
- Adaptive value of 3 hormone sequence:
	- *Feedback*
	- *Amplification*
#### Signalling Pathway
1. Hormones enter the median eminence capillaries, after exocytosis from neurones
2. Hormones carried by the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels to the anterior pituitary
3. Hormones diffuse into the interstitial fluid surrounding various anterior pituitary gland cells
4. Upon binding to specific membrane-bound receptors, hypothalamic hormones stimulate or inhibit the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones

- Minimises unintended effects in the body from systemic circulation
### Anterior Pituitary Hormones
- Control, growth, metabolism & reproduction

Long-loop: Cortisol, T3/T4 → anterior pituitary + hypothalamus
Short-loop: prolactin → hypothalamus
