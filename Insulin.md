## Synthesis of Insulin
![[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism-20240708224409171.png]]
- In the $\beta$ cell, proinsulin → insulin
	- Golgi apparatus: proinsulin → vesicles
	- Vesicles: proinsulin cleaved & modified → insulin + C-peptide
		- No known function for C-peptide
- Insulin: 51 aa’s, C-peptide: 31 aa’s
## Secretion of Insulin
![[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism-20240708225517050.png]]
1. $\uparrow$ blood glucose levels → glucose uptake through GLUT2 → glucose-6-phosphate → ATP production
2. $\uparrow$ glycolysis + ATP production → $\text K^+$ channels close → depol. → $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open → insulin secretion
	- <2% of islet insulin content is discharged during acute insulin secretion
3. Insulin is metabolised by the kidney & liver
	- Half-life is 5 minutes
### Pattern of Insulin Secretion
![[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism-20240708225723020.png]]
- After meals, blood glucose levels are mirrored by $\uparrow$ insulin
- Insulin stimulates uptake of glucose by cells
	- Primarily through muscle & adipose cells
	- $\downarrow$ plasma glucose levels
	- Via *negative feedback*, turns off insulin secretion by $\beta$-cells
- Normal: 5 mmol/L or 90 mg/dL
### Control of Insulin Secretion
![[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism-20240708230156583.png]]
#### $\uparrow[AA]$
- $\uparrow$ intracellular $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ in $\beta$ cells → $\uparrow$ insulin secretion
- Insulin → uptake of AA’s by muscle & other cells
#### Incretins (GLP-1 & GIP)
- Secreted by cells in GI tract in response to *eating*
- Bind receptor on $\beta$ cells, activate **PKA** signalling pathway
	- Amplifies intracellular effects of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ on insulin secretion
- Provide *feedforward* component to glucose regulation during ingestion of a meal
	- Insulin secretion increases more than it would if plasma glucose *alone* was a major controller
	- *Minimising absorptive peak* in plasma glucose concentration
#### Parasympathetic Activity
- Activation of parasympathetic neurons occurs during digestion
- Stimulates secretion of insulin
- Constitutes $2^\text{nd}$ type of *feedforward* regulation
#### Sympathetic Activity
- Activation of sympathetic neurons to the islets, or $\uparrow[\text{adrenaline]}$ inhibits secretion of insulin
## Insulin Receptor
![[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism-20240708231639675.png]]
- 2 copies of the protein chain come together on the outside of the cell to form the receptor site
	- Connected through the membrane to 2 tyrosine kinases
- When insulin is absent, the tyrosine kinase domains are held in a constrained position
- When insulin binds, constraints are released
	- Kinase domains first phosphorylate & activate each other
	- Then phosphorylate other proteins in the signalling network inside the cell
## Insulin Signalling Pathway
![[Endocrine Regulation of Organic Metabolism-20240708231917867.png]]
- *Akt protein kinase* orchestrates the numerous metabolic actions of insulin in hepatocytes, skeletal muscle & adipocytes
![[Insulin-20240709003135613.png]]
- **GLUT4** glucose transporter
	- Translocated from GLUT4 vesicles to cell membrane
	- Import glucose into *skeletal myocytes & adipocytes*
- Protein **phosphatases**
	- *Regulate* activity of multiple metabolic *enzymes*
- Protein complex **mTORC1**
	- Promotes protein synthesis
	- Inhibits proteasome-mediated protein degradation
- Transcription factor **SREPB-1C**
	- Orchestrates glycolysis & de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in the *liver*
		- DNL: Production of phospholipids, fatty acids & triglycerides from *excess* glucose & fructose
	- Major contributor to the *obesity* epidemic
- Transcription factor **FOXO1**
	- Gluconeogenesis
	- Hepatic assembly & export of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)
## Glucose Transporters
![[Insulin-20240709003523175.png]]
- GLUT1 is **not** insulin-dependent
	- *Always* present in the plasma membrane
	- Even when plasma insulin is low, brain cells can function
