## Rickets
- Becomes apparent during infancy or childhood
- Results in bone disease, restlessness, and slow growth
- Rare in western world
	- Not uncommon in Asia & Middle East
- *Mineralisation* of bone matrix is *deficient*
- Bones become *soft* and easily fractured
- A child suffering from rickets is typically severely **bowlegged**
	- Weight bearing on weakened developing leg bones
![[Bone Disease-20240808220530249.png|308]]
- Results from *insufficient* [[Vitamin D]] in the body
	- Poor nutrition
	- Lack of exposure to sun
	- Malabsorption syndromes in GI tract
- Treatment: daily vitamin D supplementation
### Severe Rickets
- **Symptoms:**
	- Cramps
	- Convulsions
	- Muscle twitching
	- Sharp bending of the ankle & wrist joints (tetany)
- **Treatment:**
	- Vitamin D & calcium salt supplementation
	- Surgery to correct distortions of bone & muscle
## Osteoporosis
- Both bone matrix & minerals are lost
- Result of bone resorption/formation imbalance
![[Bone Disease-20240808221147620.png|392]]
- Decrease in bone mass & strength
- Increased fragility & incidence of fractures
- Causes:
	- *Excessive* hormones favouring bone *resorption*
		- E.g,. PTH, cortisol, T3/T4
	- *Insufficient* hormones favouring bone *formation*
		- E.g., GH, insulin, IGF-1, oestrogen & testosterone

### Prevention
- Exercise
- Adequate dietary calcium & vitamin D intake
- HRT is prescribed to healthy, early menopausal women (<60)
	- Systemic estrogen â†’ $\downarrow$ rate of bone loss
	- Potential side effects prohibit prolonged use
	- Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, venous thromboembolic events, breast cancer 
### Treatment
- Biophosphonates
	- Interfere with resorption of bone by osteoclasts
- Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)
	- Activate estrogen receptors
- Calcitonin
## Hypercalcemia
### Primary Hyperparathyroidism
- Benign tumour secretes **excess** PTH & does **not** respond to negative feedback
	- $\uparrow$ bone resorption
	- $\downarrow$ renal $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion
	- $\uparrow$ production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
	- $\uparrow$ $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption from gut
- **Treatment:** Surgical removal of tumour
### Other Causes
- Other cancer types producing a PTH-related peptide that mimics PTH actions
- *Excess* vitamin D supplementation
### Symptoms
![[Bone Disease-20240808222918496.png]]
## Hypocalcium
- Can result from a loss of parathyroid gland function
	- $\downarrow$ levels of PTH & 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
	- $\downarrow$ bone resorption
	- $\downarrow$ $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption from gut
	- $\uparrow$ renal $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion
- Increases *excitability* of nerves & muscles
	- Leads to seizures & muscle spasms (*tetany*)
- Treatment: Vitamin D & calcium salt supplementation
