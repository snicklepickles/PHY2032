## Goiter
- Enlarged [[Thyroid Gland|thyroid gland]]
- Excessive activation of the TSH receptor
- Caused by *iodine* deficiency
	- In the United States, 100 mg/kg potassium iodide was added to *table salt*
	- Cost effective & simple treatment
- High prevalence in mountainous regions and areas *far* from the *sea*
	- Iodine in soil washed away by glaciation & flooding
	- *Seaweed* is one of the best sources of iodine
- Twice as common amongst *girls* than boys
- Decreases IQ ($-1\sigma$)
	- Recall [[Actions of T3#CNS|actions of T3 in CNS]]
## Negative Feedback
* Negative feedback to hypothalamus + anterior pituitary
* T4 binds to MCT8/MCT10, travels to hypothalamus/ap → T3
  T3 binds to $\beta$TSH gene to block transcription

- When T3/T4 is high, TSH & TRH is low
- When T3/T4 is low, TSH & TRH is high
## Hyperthyroidism & Hypothyroidism

Hard to measure TRH
* Produced in hypothamalus
* Little enters general circulation
* Look at TSH & T3/T4 instead
* Then inject with TRH and see response

Hypothalamic tumour
TRH → TSH → t3/t4
anterior pituitary:
TRH → cannot produce TSH → low T3/t4
