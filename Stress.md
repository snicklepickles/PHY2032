#Stress 

- Experiences that are challenging, either physically (physiological stress) or emotionally (psychological stress)
- Activates the hypothalamo-pituitary axis ([[Cortisol|cortisol]]) and the sympathetic nervous system ([[Adrenaline|adrenaline]])
## Types of Stress
* **Eustress**
	- Limited duration 
	- Manageable and leads to growth
- **Distress**
	- No sense of control
	- Prolonged or recurrent
	- Irritating, emotionally/physically draining
	- Dangerous
## Stressors
* **Acute**
	- Occur once
	- E.g., a car accident, a sprained ankle
- **Chronic**
	- Repeated or prolonged
	- E.g., day-to-day traffic jams, ongoing sleep deprivation

## Physiological Stress
- The response of the body to *any* demand placed upon it, whether that demand be interpreted as positive or negative
- Any stimulus that **threatens homeostasis** is a stressor
	- Nonspecific; different stressors → same responses
- Modern restriction:
	- Conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism
## General Adaption Syndrome
- Seyle’s GAS has 3 main phases
![[Stress-20240801193334418.png]]
- **Alarm Reaction**
	- 6-48 hours
	- Modulated by adrenaline (adrenal medulla) & noradrenaline (sympathetic NS)
- **Resistance**
	- >48 hours
	- Due to the actions of cortisol (adrenal cortex)
- **Exhaustion**
	- >1-3 months
	- Due to muscle wasting, atrophy of tissues of immune system, hyperglycaemia & vascular damage

## Coordinated Stress Response
- Stressor (internal/external, real or perceived) → sympathetic NS → adrenal medulla → $\uparrow$ catecholamines
	- Mediates **alarm** stage of stress response
	- ![[Stress-20240801193602803.png|478]]
- Stressor → $\uparrow$ CRH → $\uparrow$ ACTH → $\uparrow$ [[Adrenal Gland#Steroid Synthesis|steroid synthesis]]
	- Cortisol & aldosterone (lesser) regulate processes for coping during **resistance** phase 
		![[Stress-20240801193819617.png]]
- If resistance phase is insufficient for body to recover, **exhaustion** phase begins
	- Cortisol levels remain high and ANS is once again activated
	- Leading to raised heart rate, sweating, etc.
	- If exhaustion phase is extended, long-term damage may result
		- Prolonged vasoconstriction → ischemia → cell necrosis → heart attacks
