#Calcium
## Importance of Plasma Calcium
- Normal total plasma $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ levels: 2.2-2.6 mM
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806184021761.png|493]]
- $\downarrow$ plasma concentration → $\uparrow$ neuromuscular excitability
- $\uparrow$ plasma concentration → cardiac arrhythmias & $\downarrow$ neuromuscular excitability
	- Via effects on membrane potential

- $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is the soluble, ionised form
- Large proportion of calcium exists in active form

## Bone
- 99% of total body calcium is stored in bone
- Movement in/out is critical in controlling $[\text{Ca}^{+2}_{\text{plasma}}]$
	- By actions of osteoclasts & osteoblasts

- Minerals are deposited on osteoid
	- Particularly the crystals of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyl ions (**hydroxyapatite**)
### Bone Remodelling
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806185737950.png]]
#### Osteoclasts
- Originate from *hematopoietic* stem cells
	- Large, multi-nucleated cells
- Resorb previously formed bone by secreting:
	- *Hydrogen ions*, which dissolve the crystals
	- *Hydrolytic enzymes*, which digest the osteoid
- $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ & $\text{PO}^{2-}_4$ are released back into the blood
#### Osteoblasts
- Originate from *mesenchymal* stem cells
- Synthesise dense *cross-linked collagen*
	- The organic matrix of bone
- Acquire $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ & $\text{PO}^{2-}_4$ from the blood to produce hydroxyapatite
	- Deposited into the matrix to form mineralised tissue
#### Osteocytes
- Osteoblasts that become surrounded by calcified matrix
- Long cytoplasmic processes extend throughout the bone
	- Form tight junctions with other osteocytes
#### Regulation
- Many hormones and bone-derived growth factors & cytokines help regulate bone remodelling

##### RANK Ligand
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806190317570.png]]
- Expressed by osteoblasts
- Binds to RANK on surface of pre-osteoclasts & mature osteoclasts
- $\uparrow$ osteoclast differentiation, activity & survival → $\uparrow$ bone resorption
##### OPG
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806190447960.png]]
- Produced by osteoclasts 
- *Decoy* receptor for RANKL
	- $\downarrow$ osteoclast bone resorption
- *Post-menopausal* osteoporosis is associated with high level of bone remodelling
	- Excess RANKL > OPG
