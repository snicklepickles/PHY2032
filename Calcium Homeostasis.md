#Calcium
## Importance of Plasma Calcium
- Normal total plasma $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ levels: 2.2-2.6 mM
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806184021761.png|493]]
- $\downarrow$ plasma concentration → $\uparrow$ neuromuscular excitability
- $\uparrow$ plasma concentration → cardiac arrhythmias & $\downarrow$ neuromuscular excitability
	- Via effects on membrane potential
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806184754325.png]]
- $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is the soluble, ionised form
- Large proportion of calcium exists in active form

## Bone
- Dense connective tissue made up of several cell types
	- Surrounded by a collagen matrix (*osteoid*)
- 99% of total body calcium is stored in bone
- Movement in/out is critical in controlling $[\text{Ca}^{+2}_{\text{plasma}}]$
	- By actions of osteoclasts & osteoblasts
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806185026840.png]]
- Minerals are deposited on *osteoid*
	- Particularly the crystals of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyl ions (**hydroxyapatite**)
### Bone Remodelling
- The cycle of bone *resorption* and new bone *deposition*
- Depends on systemic hormone action for an adequate supply of calcium & phosphate
- Depends on local hormones for communication between osteoblasts & osteoclasts

- **Red** line = **inhibition**, black line = stimulation

#### Osteoclasts
- Originate from *hematopoietic* stem cells
	- Large, multi-nucleated cells
- Resorb previously formed bone by secreting:
	- *Hydrogen ions*, which dissolve the crystals
	- *Hydrolytic enzymes*, which digest the osteoid
- $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ & $\text{PO}^{2-}_4$ are released back into the blood
#### Osteoblasts
- Originate from *mesenchymal* stem cells
- Synthesise dense *cross-linked collagen*
	- The organic matrix of bone
- Acquire $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ & $\text{PO}^{2-}_4$ from the blood to produce hydroxyapatite
	- Deposited into the matrix to form mineralised tissue
#### Osteocytes
- Osteoblasts that become surrounded by calcified matrix
- Long cytoplasmic processes extend throughout the bone
	- Form tight junctions with other osteocytes
#### Regulation
- Many hormones and bone-derived growth factors & cytokines help regulate bone remodelling

##### RANK Ligand
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806190317570.png]]
- Expressed by osteoblasts
- Binds to RANK on surface of pre-osteoclasts & mature osteoclasts
- $\uparrow$ osteoclast differentiation, activity & survival → $\uparrow$ bone resorption
##### OPG
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240806190447960.png]]
- Produced by osteoclasts 
- *Decoy* receptor for RANKL
	- $\downarrow$ osteoclast bone resorption
- *Post-menopausal* osteoporosis is associated with high level of bone remodelling
	- Excess RANKL > OPG
## Kidney
- Effector sites for calcium regulation
- Filter the blood and eliminate soluble wastes
- In the process, cells in the tubules reabsorb most of the necessary solutes that were filtered
	- Minimises loss in urine
- Urinary excretion of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ = amount filtered into tubules - amount reabsorbed and returned to the blood
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240808204344481.png]]
- *Control* of calcium excretion is exerted mainly on *reabsorption*
	- Via [[Parathyroid Hormone]]
## GI Tract
![[Calcium Homeostasis-20240808204329740.png]]
- Absorption of most solutes (sodium, potassium) from GI → blood is normally 100%
- Considerable amount of ingested $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ is *not* absorbed from the small intestine
	- Leaves body in faeces
- Under [[Parathyroid Hormone|parathyroid gland]], large regulated increases/decreases can occur in amount of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ absorbed
- *Hormonal control* of calcium absorption is the *major* means for regulating total-body-calcium balance
